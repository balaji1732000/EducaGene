# Active Context: Manim Video Generator

## 1. Current Work Focus

- **UI Refinement:** Implementing user-requested UI changes based on visual mockups/inspiration. This includes layout adjustments, color scheme changes, background image integration, and ensuring UI elements (like buttons, input fields) are visible and functional.
- **Frontend Stability:** Addressing JavaScript errors related to DOM manipulation, ensuring event listeners are correctly attached and elements are present when scripts attempt to access them.
- **Workflow Robustness:** (Ongoing) Ensuring the backend LangGraph workflow handles potential errors gracefully, especially during LLM calls, code evaluation, and Manim rendering steps.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **UI Overhaul:**
    - Removed the code display panel from the UI.
    - Changed color themes (initially emerald/pink, then emerald/blue, then amber/orange logo with white text).
    - Added a full-screen GIF background.
    - Updated navbar/footer appearance (semi-transparent dark gray).
    - Changed logo icon to an open book.
    - Updated button styles (Generate button now solid emerald).
- **JavaScript Fixes:**
    - Changed the event listener from form `submit` to button `click` for the "Generate" action.
    - Wrapped JS execution in `DOMContentLoaded` listener.
    - Added optional chaining (`?.`) to DOM element access in JS to prevent errors if elements are missing.
    - Re-introduced basic HTML placeholders (`#loading`, `#results` divs) in `index.html` to allow the JS to show/hide status and video output correctly.
- **Backend:** (Prior to UI focus) Significant work on refining prompts for LLMs, implementing evaluation/revision loops for code generation, handling Manim rendering errors, and integrating voiceover generation. Removed the `cleanup_node` to persist temporary files.

## 3. Next Steps

- **Verify UI Functionality:** Confirm that the latest UI changes are correctly rendered and that the "Generate" button successfully triggers the backend API call, displays the loading state, and shows the final video upon completion.
- **Integrate "Inspire Me" / "Enhance Script":** Implement functionality for the "Inspire me" button and the "Enhance script" toggle introduced in the UI mockup (currently placeholders). This will likely require new backend logic or modifications to existing prompts/workflows.
- **Address JS Errors:** Fully resolve any remaining frontend JavaScript errors observed in the browser console.
- **Review User Flow:** Test the end-to-end user experience with the new UI to ensure it's smooth and intuitive.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **UI Design:** Balancing the aesthetic goals from the inspiration image with the existing functional requirements (displaying video, download button, loading/error states).
- **Frontend Complexity:** Keeping the frontend JavaScript relatively simple while providing necessary feedback to the user. Avoiding complex state management unless necessary.
- **Backend Integration:** Ensuring the frontend correctly interacts with the `/generate` endpoint and handles the JSON response (including `final_video_url` and potential `warning` or `error` messages).
