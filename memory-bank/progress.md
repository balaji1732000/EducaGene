# Progress: Manim Video Generator

## 1. What Works

- **Core Workflow Execution:** The LangGraph state machine successfully orchestrates the main steps: setup -> plan -> generate script -> evaluate -> render -> generate voiceover -> combine.
- **Concept to Plan:** The `plan_video_node` uses an LLM to generate a structured JSON plan from a user concept (though parsing can sometimes fail).
- **Plan to Script:** The `generate_full_script_node` takes the plan (or raw text if parsing failed) and generates a single Manim Python script containing one class.
- **Code Evaluation:** The `evaluate_code_node` uses an LLM to review the generated script against the plan and basic Manim best practices, outputting a 'SATISFIED' or 'REVISION_NEEDED' verdict and feedback.
- **Code Revision Loop:**
    - **Evaluation-Based:** If evaluation verdict is 'REVISION_NEEDED', the workflow loops back to `generate_full_script_node` with the feedback to attempt correction (up to `max_script_revisions`).
    - **Render-Error-Based:** If `render_combined_video_node` fails, the workflow loops back to `generate_full_script_node` with the Manim error message to attempt correction (up to `max_script_revisions`).
- **Manim Rendering:** The `render_combined_video_node` successfully executes Manim as a subprocess to render the generated script into a silent MP4 video. Handles finding the output file in Manim's directory structure.
- **Voiceover Script Generation:** The `generate_final_script_node` uses Gemini Vision to analyze the rendered silent video and generate a corresponding narration script.
- **TTS Audio Generation:** The `generate_audio_node` uses Azure TTS to convert the voiceover script into a WAV audio file.
- **Final Video Combination:** The `combine_final_video_audio_node` uses ffmpeg to combine the silent video and the generated audio into a final MP4. Includes basic audio stretching logic to match video duration.
- **Basic UI Interaction:** The frontend allows users to input a concept, click "Generate", see a loading state, and view the final video with a download link if successful. Handles basic error display via alerts.
- **Logging:** Comprehensive logging to both console and `app.log` file captures workflow steps, LLM calls, Manim output, and errors.
- **Configuration:** API keys and endpoints are loaded from a `.env` file.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Refine

- **"Inspire Me" Functionality:** Implement the logic for the "Inspire me" button in the UI (likely involves calling an LLM with a prompt to suggest video ideas).
- **"Enhance Script" Functionality:** Implement the logic for the "Enhance script" toggle (could modify prompts, trigger different LLM calls, or apply post-processing).
- **UI Stability/Polish:**
    - Ensure consistent styling and element visibility across all states (idle, loading, results, error).
    - Replace `alert()` calls for errors/warnings with integrated UI elements (e.g., the `#error` and `#warningArea` divs that exist but might not be fully utilized by the current JS).
    - Refine the visual design further based on user feedback or mockups.
- **Error Handling Robustness:**
    - Improve parsing of LLM outputs (JSON plan, evaluation verdict) to be more resilient to variations.
    - Potentially add more specific error handling within nodes (e.g., for different types of Manim errors).
    - Provide more informative error messages to the user via the UI.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Continuously refine LLM prompts for better plan quality, code generation accuracy/relevance, more reliable evaluation, and more natural voiceover scripts.
- **Workflow Edge Cases:** Test with more complex or ambiguous concepts to identify potential failure points. Consider adding limits or checks for very long generated scripts/videos.
- **Performance Optimization:** Profile the workflow to identify bottlenecks (likely LLM calls and Manim rendering). Explore options like caching, parallel execution (if applicable within LangGraph), or using faster LLM models where appropriate.
- **Testing:** Implement more structured testing (unit tests for helper functions, integration tests for workflow segments).

## 3. Current Status

- The application is functional end-to-end for the core "concept-to-video" flow.
- Significant UI changes have been implemented recently based on user requests and inspiration images.
- Frontend JavaScript has been patched to handle DOM loading and missing elements, enabling the basic Generate -> Loading -> Video display loop.
- The backend workflow includes robust loops for code evaluation and revision based on LLM feedback or Manim rendering errors.

## 4. Known Issues

- **UI Glitches:** Potential inconsistencies in element visibility or styling due to recent rapid changes. The "Generate" button visibility was recently fixed. Loader and results display were recently re-added.
- **LLM Reliability:** The quality and correctness of LLM outputs (plans, code, evaluations) can vary. Sometimes generated code might be irrelevant or contain subtle errors that evaluation misses. Content filtering can occasionally interrupt the flow.
- **JavaScript Errors:** Although patched, frontend JS might still have minor issues, especially related to elements that were removed and re-added (e.g., error/warning display areas). The `copyCodeBtn` listener will fail as the corresponding element was removed.
- **Performance:** Video generation can be slow, especially for complex concepts, due to LLM response times and Manim rendering duration.
